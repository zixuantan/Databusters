# Databusters: The Data Science and Economics Challenge

This repo contains the deliverables submitted by Team 03 for the Data Science and Economics Challenge. The finalised models can be found in NUS_DSESC_DATABUSTERS_03.ipynb, all of which were trained on the Quarterly Data.csv. Q1'25_Linear_Model_(poor_performance).ipynb contains a model that was scrapped for poor in-sample performance.
